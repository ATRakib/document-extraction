You are an expert Angular architect (Angular 17+).

I will provide:
1. My existing Angular project code structure (already running).
2. A separate HTML + JS UI (document upload, extraction, authentication UI).
3. My FastAPI backend code (authentication, suppliers, products, document extraction APIs).


Your task:
Rebuild the entire UI and logic in Angular with the following strict requirements:

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- The design must look user friendly
- But the layout must follow my Angular project’s structure.
- Use grid-based responsive design.
- Use clean Angular folder structure: components, pages, services, models, guards, interceptors.
- No extra UI, no extra animations, no unnecessary styling.

FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
Use Angular services for API calls.
- Full authentication system (login, logout).
- Role-based UI 
- Profile page (show user info + role).
- Supplier management page (list, add, edit).
- Product management page (list, add, edit).
- Document upload + document extraction page.
- Extracted result must be saved via service.
- Every module must have its own menu item.
- Dashboard must be clean and simple (grid layout).



IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change my project structure.
- Do NOT create unnecessary files.
- Do NOT give explanations, only code.

Now I will paste:
1. My Angular project code structure
2. My HTML + JS UI code
2. My FastAPI backend code

After that, generate the full Angular code following the rules above.
